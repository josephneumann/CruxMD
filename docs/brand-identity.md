# CruxMD Brand Identity

## Brand Essence

**"The decisive point of care."**

CruxMD exists at the crux—where clinical data becomes clinical insight. It handles the cognitive load of recall and pattern recognition so physicians can focus on what only humans can do: be present with patients.

---

## Brand Statement

CruxMD is a thinking partner for physicians who refuse to choose between thoroughness and presence. It's the quiet confidence of knowing nothing is missed—freeing clinicians to bring their full humanity to every patient encounter.

Premium without flash. Capable without noise. The tool that elevates care by getting out of the way.

## Brand Principles

### 1. Quiet Competence

The interface speaks through work, not words. No celebratory animations, no achievement badges, no "Great question!" affirmations. When CruxMD surfaces an insight, it presents it plainly: "Here's what I found." Trust is built through reliability, not reassurance.

### 2. Earned Confidence

Clinicians should feel certain, not hopeful. Every insight traces to source. Every recommendation has grounding. The goal isn't to impress—it's to be trusted enough that physicians can stop double-checking and start *thinking*.

### 3. Creative Unblocking

When the cognitive burden of "did I miss something?" lifts, physicians rediscover curiosity. CruxMD creates space for the questions that matter: not "what are the labs?" but "what's really going on with this patient?"

### 4. Understated Premium

The quality is in the details others don't notice: the information hierarchy that feels obvious, the interaction that requires no explanation, the response that anticipated the follow-up. It sets users apart without announcing itself.

### 5. Human Presence, Machine Precision

CruxMD handles the exhaustive—reviewing every lab, every medication, every past encounter—so clinicians can handle the irreplaceable: eye contact, intuition, the therapeutic relationship. The machine is precise so the doctor can be present.

## Visual Identity

### Palette

Warm, grounded, natural—not clinical sterile. Based on Anthropic's brand palette:

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Book Cloth (terracotta) | `#CC785C` | Primary actions, focus states |
| **Positive** | Sage | `#7D8B6F` | Success, positive insights |
| **Accent** | Periwinkle | `#8B8FC7` | Secondary highlights |
| **Warm** | Kraft | `#D4A27F` | Warnings, warm accents |
| **Background** | Ivory | `#FAFAF7` | Light mode base |
| **Surface** | White | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, elevated surfaces |
| **Text** | Slate | `#191919` | Primary text |
| **Muted** | Cloud | `#666663` | Secondary text |

Terracotta and sage suggest organic intelligence; ivory light, not fluorescent.

### Surfaces

Clean and crisp, not textured. Warmth comes from color, not material simulation.

### Typography

Clear, readable, unpretentious. No display fonts. The interface should feel like well-set medical literature, not a tech product.

### Motion

Purposeful, brief, functional. Transitions serve comprehension, not delight. No typing animations, no streaming text effects, no celebratory flourishes.

### Density

Spacious but not sparse. Room to think. The forested view, not the cramped office.

## Voice Guidelines

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Insights** | Factual, direct | "Creatinine trending up over 3 months." |
| **Empty states** | Calm, not apologetic | "No active medications on file." |
| **Errors** | Clear, actionable | "Unable to retrieve labs. Retry?" |
| **Suggestions** | Optional, not pushy | "Related: renal function trend" |

### Voice Principles

- **State facts, not feelings** — "3 active conditions identified" not "I found some important conditions!"
- **Be direct, not terse** — Enough words for clarity, no more
- **Suggest, don't push** — Options, not directives
- **Trust the user** — No hand-holding, no over-explanation

## What CruxMD Is Not

| Rejection | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Not enterprise** | No admin dashboards, permission matrices, or deployment complexity |
| **Not startup-y** | No growth loops, engagement metrics, or manufactured "delight" |
| **Not gimmicky** | No AI theatrics, typing animations, or chatbot personality |
| **Not futuristic** | No glowing edges, dark mode defaults, or sci-fi aesthetic |
| **Not hyped** | No "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "powered by AI" badges |

## The Aspirational User

A physician who:

- Never misses a clinically relevant detail
- Has patients who feel genuinely seen and heard
- Uses sophisticated tools without performing sophistication
- Stays ahead of the curve by mastering fundamentals, not chasing trends
- Values craft over flash

---

## The Metaphor

> *A well-organized study with medical textbooks—but with a view of a forested hillside in early morning mist.*

**The study**: Order, expertise, the accumulated weight of medical knowledge, everything in its place.

**The view**: Space to breathe, something alive beyond the work, the reminder that medicine serves *life*, not just data.

**The morning mist**: Clarity emerging gradually, not forced. Patience. The work reveals itself.

---

## Name Etymology

**Crux** — The decisive or most important point; the heart of the matter.

**MD** — Medical Doctor. The user, not the data. CruxMD exists to serve physicians.

Together: *The decisive point for the physician.*
