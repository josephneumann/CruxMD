## Brand Foundation

### Brand Essence

**"The decisive point of care."**

CruxMD exists at the crux—where clinical data becomes clinical insight. It handles the cognitive load of recall and pattern recognition so physicians can focus on what only humans can do: be present with patients.

### Brand Statement

CruxMD is a thinking partner for physicians who refuse to choose between thoroughness and presence. It's the quiet confidence of knowing nothing is missed—freeing clinicians to bring their full humanity to every patient encounter.

Premium without flash. Capable without noise. The tool that elevates care by getting out of the way.

### Mission

To give physicians the confidence that nothing is missed, so they can focus on what matters: the patient in front of them.

### Vision

A world where clinical intelligence amplifies human care rather than replacing it—where technology handles the exhaustive so physicians can handle the irreplaceable.

### Brand Story

Medicine has a cognitive load problem. Physicians juggle thousands of data points per patient while trying to maintain the human connection that defines great care. Most technology adds to this burden—more clicks, more alerts, more noise.

CruxMD inverts this. By handling pattern recognition, temporal analysis, and comprehensive review, it creates space for physicians to think deeply rather than frantically. The interface recedes; clinical insight emerges.

The name says it all: Crux—the decisive point, the heart of the matter. MD—the physician it serves. Together, the decisive point for the doctor.

### Name Etymology

| Component | Meaning | Significance |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Crux** | The decisive or most important point; the heart of the matter | The product finds what matters in clinical data |
| **MD** | Medical Doctor | The user, not the data. The physician is centered. |
| **Together** | *The decisive point for the physician* | Where data becomes insight becomes action |

### Brand Principles

#### 1. Quiet Competence
The interface speaks through work, not words. No celebratory animations, no achievement badges, no "Great question!" affirmations. When CruxMD surfaces an insight, it presents it plainly: "Here's what I found." Trust is built through reliability, not reassurance.

#### 2. Earned Confidence
Clinicians should feel certain, not hopeful. Every insight traces to source. Every recommendation has grounding. The goal isn't to impress—it's to be trusted enough that physicians can stop double-checking and start *thinking*.

#### 3. Creative Unblocking
When the cognitive burden of "did I miss something?" lifts, physicians rediscover curiosity. CruxMD creates space for the questions that matter: not "what are the labs?" but "what's really going on with this patient?"

#### 4. Understated Premium
The quality is in the details others don't notice: the information hierarchy that feels obvious, the interaction that requires no explanation, the response that anticipated the follow-up. It sets users apart without announcing itself.

#### 5. Human Presence, Machine Precision
CruxMD handles the exhaustive—reviewing every lab, every medication, every past encounter—so clinicians can handle the irreplaceable: eye contact, intuition, the therapeutic relationship. The machine is precise so the doctor can be present.

### The Central Metaphor

> *A well-organized study with medical textbooks—but with a view of a forested hillside in early morning mist.*

This metaphor guides every design decision:

| Element | Meaning | Design Implication |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **The study** | Order, expertise, accumulated knowledge | Clean organization, logical hierarchy, everything findable |
| **Medical textbooks** | Authority, depth, trustworthiness | Typography like well-set literature, not tech products |
| **The view** | Space to breathe, life beyond data | Generous whitespace, room for thought |
| **Forested hillside** | Organic, natural, alive | Warm palette (sage, terracotta), not clinical sterile |
| **Morning mist** | Clarity emerging gradually | Information reveals itself, not all at once |

### Target Audience

#### Primary: The Thoughtful Physician

**Demographics:**
- Practicing physicians (MDs/DOs) across specialties
- 30-55 years old
- Comfortable with technology but not defined by it
- High patient volume, limited time per encounter

**Psychographics:**
- Values thoroughness but feels time-pressured
- Nostalgic for the days of longer patient encounters
- Skeptical of "AI hype" but open to genuine productivity gains
- Identifies as a craftsperson, not a technician
- Frustrated by EHR bloat and alert fatigue

**Aspirational Identity:**
- The doctor who never misses anything
- The doctor patients remember as genuinely present
- Ahead of the curve without chasing trends
- Uses sophisticated tools without performing sophistication

#### What They're Not

- Early adopters seeking novelty
- Technologists excited by AI itself
- Administrators seeking metrics dashboards
- Patients or consumers

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor Type | Their Approach | CruxMD Difference |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| EHR add-ons | More features, more clicks | Less interface, more insight |
| Clinical decision support | Alert-heavy, interruptive | Contextual, conversational |
| AI chatbots | Performative intelligence | Quiet competence |
| Analytics dashboards | Population-level metrics | Individual patient depth |

**Positioning Statement:**
For physicians who refuse to choose between thoroughness and presence, CruxMD is the clinical intelligence partner that handles comprehensive review so you can focus on the patient—unlike EHR tools that add cognitive load or AI chatbots that perform rather than serve.

## Logo & Brandmark

### Concept Direction

The CruxMD logo should embody: **precision without coldness, expertise without pretension, clarity without sterility**.

#### Primary Concept: The Crux Mark

The "crux" is literally a cross or intersection point. The logo should suggest:
- A meeting point (where data meets insight)
- A decisive mark (like a physician's notation)
- Stability and groundedness (not floating or abstract)

**Recommended approach:** A refined wordmark with a subtle graphic element, not a complex symbol. The name is strong; let it carry weight.

#### Logo Construction Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Wordmark-forward** | "CruxMD" is distinctive; don't hide it behind a symbol |
| **Subtle mark** | If including a symbol, integrate it with the type (e.g., the X in Crux) |
| **No medical clichés** | No stethoscopes, hearts, crosses, or caduceus |
| **No tech clichés** | No circuits, nodes, gradients, or glows |
| **Warm, not cold** | Book Cloth terracotta as brand color, not blue |

#### Typography for Logotype

The wordmark should use a typeface that suggests:
- **Authority** — weight and presence
- **Clarity** — highly legible, no ambiguity
- **Warmth** — humanist characteristics, not geometric coldness
- **Timelessness** — no trendy styling

**Recommended characteristics:**
- Medium to semi-bold weight
- Subtle humanist touches (slight stroke contrast, open apertures)
- Clean terminals (no excessive serifs or decoration)
- Generous letterspacing for "MD" to read as separate

#### Potential Wordmark Treatments

**Option A: Unified Wordmark**
```
CruxMD
```
Single weight, slight emphasis on "MD" through spacing or case.

**Option B: Split Emphasis**
```
Crux MD
```
Small gap between Crux and MD, MD in a slightly different weight or size.

**Option C: Subtle Integration**
The X in "Crux" subtly rendered as a crosshair or intersection point, integrated naturally into the letterform.

#### Logo Specifications

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Minimum size** | 24px height for digital, 12mm for print |
| **Clear space** | Height of the "C" on all sides minimum |
| **Primary color** | Book Cloth `#CC785C` on light backgrounds |
| **Reversed** | Ivory `#FAFAF7` on dark backgrounds |
| **Monochrome** | Slate `#191919` when color unavailable |
| **Forbidden** | Gradients, shadows, outlines, rotation, distortion |

#### Logo Variations

| Variant | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Primary** | Marketing, large formats, hero placements |
| **Compact** | App icon, favicon, small spaces |
| **Monochrome** | Single-color contexts, embroidery, stamps |
| **Reversed** | Dark backgrounds, photography overlays |

### Favicon & App Icon

For small formats, consider:
- Lettermark "Cx" or "C" with subtle crux mark
- Simple, recognizable at 16x16px
- Works in both light and dark contexts

## Color System

### Philosophy

The CruxMD palette is **warm, grounded, and natural**—deliberately rejecting clinical sterility. Colors evoke:
- A well-appointed study (terracotta, leather, wood tones)
- Early morning light (ivory, soft whites)
- The natural world (sage, forest tones)
- Thoughtful contemplation (muted, not vibrant)

### Type Scale

Based on a 1.25 ratio (major third), anchored at 16px:

| Name | Size | Line Height | Weight | Use Case |
|------|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **xs** | 12px / 0.75rem | 1.5 | Regular | Captions, metadata |
| **sm** | 14px / 0.875rem | 1.5 | Regular | Secondary text, labels |
| **base** | 16px / 1rem | 1.6 | Regular | Body text, primary content |
| **lg** | 18px / 1.125rem | 1.5 | Regular | Lead paragraphs |
| **xl** | 20px / 1.25rem | 1.4 | Medium | Section headers |
| **2xl** | 24px / 1.5rem | 1.3 | Medium | Page section titles |
| **3xl** | 30px / 1.875rem | 1.2 | Medium | Page titles |

## Visual Language

### Photography & Imagery Direction

CruxMD generally **avoids photography** in the interface. When imagery is needed:

#### Acceptable Imagery

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| **Abstract/ambient** | Soft, out-of-focus nature scenes; morning light; forest canopy |
| **Environmental** | Empty, well-lit clinical spaces; the view from the window |
| **Documentary** | Real moments of care (not staged stock photos) |

#### Forbidden Imagery

| Type | Why Avoid |
|------|-----------|
| Stock photos of doctors | Inauthentic, cliché |
| Smiling patients | Performative, distracting |
| Technology glamour shots | Undermines quiet competence |
| Infographic-style illustrations | Too startup-y |
| AI/robot imagery | Undermines human-centered positioning |

#### Imagery Treatment

When using photos:
- Muted, warm color grading
- Soft focus when appropriate
- No harsh contrasts
- Consider duotone in brand colors (Ivory + Book Cloth)

### Iconography

#### Icon Style

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Style** | Outlined, 1.5-2px stroke |
| **Corners** | Slightly rounded (2px radius) |
| **Grid** | 24x24px base, scale proportionally |
| **Color** | Single color (inherit from context) |
| **Complexity** | Simple, recognizable at 16px |

#### Icon Personality

Icons should feel:
- **Functional** — Tools, not decorations
- **Clear** — Immediately recognizable
- **Consistent** — Same stroke weight and style
- **Warm** — Slightly rounded, not sharp/technical

#### Recommended Icon Sets

| Set | Characteristics |
|-----|-----------------|
| **Lucide** | Clean, consistent, MIT license |
| **Heroicons** | Tailwind ecosystem, two styles |
| **Phosphor** | Flexible weights, friendly |

**Avoid:** Filled icons (too heavy), emoji-style icons (too playful), complex illustrations.

### Data Visualization Principles

Charts and graphs should embody **clarity over decoration**:

#### General Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data-ink ratio** | Maximize data, minimize chrome |
| **No 3D effects** | Flat, honest representation |
| **No gradients** | Solid colors from palette |
| **Subtle gridlines** | Cloud Light, dashed if needed |
| **Clear labels** | Direct labeling > legends |
| **Purposeful color** | Color encodes meaning, not decoration |

#### Chart-Specific Guidelines

**Line Charts (Lab Trends)**
- Stroke: 2px, rounded line caps
- Points: 6px circles at data points
- Fill: Optional 10% opacity area fill
- Reference ranges: Horizontal bands with Kraft/Sage

**Bar Charts**
- Border radius: 4px top corners
- Spacing: 40% gap between bars
- Horizontal labels: Always prefer horizontal orientation

**Tables**
- Alternating rows: Not needed with good spacing
- Borders: Horizontal only, subtle
- Number alignment: Right-aligned, monospace

### Illustration Style

CruxMD minimizes illustration. When needed:

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Style** | Simple line drawings, minimal fills |
| **Color** | Brand palette only, 2-3 colors max |
| **Subject** | Abstract/conceptual, never literal people |
| **Use cases** | Empty states, onboarding only |

### Graphic Elements

#### Dividers and Lines

- Horizontal rules: 1px, Ivory Dark
- Section breaks: 24-48px spacing, no visible line
- Card separation: Elevation (shadow) or spacing, not borders

#### Shapes

Minimal use. When needed:
- Rounded rectangles: 8px radius (matches card radius)
- Circles: Status indicators, avatars only
- No decorative shapes or patterns

All components should feel:
- **Functional** — Clearly interactive or informational
- **Clean** — Minimal borders, shadows only for elevation
- **Warm** — Using palette colors, not pure grays
- **Consistent** — Same patterns repeated

### Cards

```
Background: White
Border: None (use shadow for elevation)
Border-radius: 8px
Shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
Padding: 20px
```

**Hover state:** Subtle shadow increase, not color change.

### Buttons

| Variant | Background | Text | Border | Use Case |
|---------|------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Primary** | Book Cloth | White | None | Primary actions |
| **Secondary** | Ivory Dark | Slate Dark | None | Secondary actions |
| **Ghost** | Transparent | Book Cloth | None | Tertiary actions |
| **Destructive** | Error | White | None | Dangerous actions |

**States:**
- Hover: Slight darkening (filter)
- Active: Slight inset (transform)
- Disabled: 50% opacity

### Inputs

```
Background: White
Border: 1px solid Ivory Dark
Border-radius: 6px
Height: 40px
Padding: 12px horizontal

Focus: Border becomes Book Cloth, ring 2px Book Cloth @ 25% opacity
Error: Border becomes Error, subtle Error background
```

### Insight Cards

Clinical insights use specialized styling:

| Type | Left Border | Background | Icon |
|------|-------------|------------|------|
| **Info** | 3px Focus Blue | Ivory Medium | Info circle |
| **Warning** | 3px Kraft | Manilla @ 50% | Alert triangle |
| **Critical** | 3px Error | Error @ 10% | Alert octagon |
| **Positive** | 3px Sage | Sage @ 10% | Check circle |

### Chat Interface

**User messages:**
```
Alignment: Right
Background: Ivory Dark
Border-radius: 16px 16px 4px 16px
Padding: 12px 16px
Max-width: 80%
```

**Agent messages:**
```
Alignment: Left
Background: White
Border: 1px solid Ivory Dark
Border-radius: 16px 16px 16px 4px
Padding: 16px
Max-width: 90%
```

**Thinking indicator:**
- Simple pulsing dot (Book Cloth)
- Text: "Thinking..." in Cloud Dark
- No skeleton loaders or elaborate animations

### Navigation

**Sidebar:**
```
Background: Ivory Medium
Width: 260px
Padding: 16px
```

## Brand Applications

### Application Interface

The primary expression of the brand is the product itself. Every screen should:
- Use the color palette correctly
- Follow typography hierarchy
- Maintain appropriate density
- Speak in the brand voice

### Marketing (Future)

When marketing materials are needed:

**Website:**
- Minimal, content-focused
- Ivory Light background
- No hero images of fake interfaces
- Real screenshots when ready
- Prose-driven, not bullet-point-driven

**Collateral:**
- Business cards: Ivory stock, Book Cloth type
- Presentations: Minimal slides, generous whitespace
- Documentation: Clean, technical, no marketing fluff

### What to Avoid in Applications

| Pattern | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| Dashboard-style home screen | Enterprise feeling |
| Feature tours / tooltips | Startup-y onboarding |
| Achievement badges | Gamification, patronizing |
| "AI" badges or labels | Hyped, obvious |
| Chatbot avatar | Gimmicky, creates personality |
| Confetti or celebrations | Patronizing |
| "Powered by..." logos | Distracting |

## Do's and Don'ts

### Color

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use Book Cloth sparingly for emphasis | Saturate the interface with terracotta |
| Let Ivory and White dominate | Use pure gray (#808080) |
| Use clinical insight colors semantically | Use red for non-critical information |
| Ensure sufficient contrast | Use low-contrast color combinations |

### Typography

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use consistent type scale | Introduce arbitrary font sizes |
| Maintain generous line height | Compress text tightly |
| Let body text be Slate Dark | Use light gray text for primary content |
| Use medium weight for headings only | Bold everything for emphasis |

### Voice

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| State facts plainly | Editorialize or emote |
| Use clinical terminology | Invent new jargon |
| Be specific and concrete | Be vague or hedge |
| Write complete, clear messages | Use fragments that confuse |

### Imagery

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use abstract, ambient imagery sparingly | Use stock photos of doctors |
| Let the interface be the visual | Cover it with decorative graphics |
| Use icons functionally | Use icons decoratively |
| Keep charts clean and data-forward | Add 3D effects or gradients to charts |

### Interaction

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use subtle, purposeful transitions | Animate everything |
| Let content load progressively | Use skeleton loaders extensively |
| Keep loading indicators minimal | Add playful loading animations |
| Make interactive elements obvious | Require hover to discover actions |

### Layout

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Give content room to breathe | Pack information densely everywhere |
| Use consistent spacing scale | Use arbitrary spacing values |
| Align to grid | Let elements float arbitrarily |
| Limit content width for readability | Let text span full-width screens |

## What CruxMD Is Not

A summary of rejections to guide decision-making:

| Rejection | What It Means | Example to Avoid |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Not enterprise** | No admin complexity | Permission matrices, role management UI |
| **Not startup-y** | No growth hacking | "Invite 3 friends to unlock!" |
| **Not gimmicky** | No AI theater | Typing animations, "thinking deeply..." |
| **Not futuristic** | No sci-fi aesthetics | Glowing edges, dark mode default, neon |
| **Not hyped** | No marketing speak | "Revolutionary AI-powered platform" |
| **Not clinical-sterile** | No hospital coldness | Pure white + blue, medical stock photos |
| **Not consumer health** | No wellness app energy | Bright colors, illustrations of bodies |
