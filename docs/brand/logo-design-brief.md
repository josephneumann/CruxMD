# CruxMD Logo Design Brief

> A complete specification for designing the CruxMD wordmark and brand identity

---

## Executive Summary

We need a wordmark logo for **CruxMD**, a clinical intelligence platform for physicians. The logo should embody quiet competence, warmth, and precision—not the cold, clinical blue of healthcare technology or the flashy gradients of AI startups.

The central creative concept: **the letter X in "Crux" is treated as a subtle graphic element representing the decisive intersection point**—where clinical data meets clinical insight.

---

## Brand Context

### What is CruxMD?

CruxMD is a thinking partner for physicians. It handles the cognitive burden of reviewing patient data—labs, medications, conditions, history—so doctors can focus on what matters: being present with the patient in front of them.

### Brand Personality

| Attribute | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Quiet competence** | Speaks through work, not words. No flash, no hype. |
| **Earned confidence** | Trustworthy enough that physicians stop double-checking |
| **Understated premium** | Quality in details others don't notice |
| **Warm, not cold** | Organic, natural, human—not clinical sterile |

### Brand Metaphor

> *A well-organized study with medical textbooks—but with a view of a forested hillside in early morning mist.*

The logo should evoke: expertise, order, warmth, natural light, calm authority.

### What CruxMD Is NOT

| Rejection | Meaning for Logo |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Not enterprise** | No corporate stiffness |
| **Not startup-y** | No trendy gradients or geometric minimalism |
| **Not gimmicky** | No clever tricks that age poorly |
| **Not futuristic** | No sci-fi, no glowing effects |
| **Not clinical-sterile** | No hospital blue, no cold whites |

---

## Name Analysis

### Etymology

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Crux** | The decisive or most important point; the heart of the matter. Also: a cross or intersection. |
| **MD** | Medical Doctor—the user, not the data. The physician is centered. |
| **Together** | "The decisive point for the physician" |

### Pronunciation

- "Crux" rhymes with "ducks" — /krʌks/
- "MD" pronounced as letters — "em-dee"
- Full: "Crux-em-dee"

### Visual Parsing

The name should read as two parts:
- **Crux** — the product/concept
- **MD** — the professional context

These can be visually distinguished through spacing, weight, or subtle treatment—but should feel unified, not split.

---

## Color Specification

### Primary Brand Color: Book Cloth

The logo's primary color is a warm terracotta called "Book Cloth"—evoking leather-bound medical texts, warmth, and organic authority.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Book Cloth |
| **Hex** | `#CC785C` |
| **RGB** | 204, 120, 92 |
| **HSL** | 15°, 51%, 58% |
| **Pantone** | Closest: PMS 7522 C or PMS 7618 C |
| **CMYK** | 0, 55, 65, 15 (approximate—verify for print) |

**Character:** Warm terracotta with slight coral undertones. Not orange, not brown, not rust. Think: aged leather, terra cotta pottery, book cloth binding.

### Logo Color Applications

| Context | Color |
|---------|-------|
| **Primary (on light backgrounds)** | Book Cloth `#CC785C` |
| **On dark backgrounds** | Ivory Light `#FAFAF7` |
| **Monochrome (print/embroidery)** | Slate Dark `#191919` |
| **Monochrome reversed** | White `#FFFFFF` |

### Colors to Avoid

| Color | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Blue (any shade) | Too clinical, too tech, too expected |
| Teal/cyan | Same—medical technology cliché |
| Bright red | Too urgent, too aggressive |
| Neon/saturated colors | Too startup-y, too loud |
| Gradients | Too trendy, ages poorly |
| Black as primary | Too stark, loses warmth |

### Supporting Palette (for context, not for logo)

The broader brand uses these colors. The logo itself should be single-color (Book Cloth), but understanding the palette helps with aesthetic alignment:

| Name | Hex | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| Ivory Light | `#FAFAF7` | Warm off-white background |
| Slate Dark | `#191919` | Near-black text |
| Sage | `#7D8B6F` | Muted green accent |
| Periwinkle | `#8B8FC7` | Soft purple accent |
| Kraft | `#D4A27F` | Warm tan |

## Typography Direction

### Overall Character

The wordmark typography should feel like **well-set medical literature**: authoritative, readable, timeless—not like a tech product or startup.

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Category** | Humanist sans-serif |
| **Weight** | Medium to Semi-bold (500-600) |
| **Stroke contrast** | Subtle (slight thick/thin variation) |
| **Terminals** | Clean, not geometric |
| **Apertures** | Open (aids legibility) |
| **Overall feel** | Warm, professional, confident |

### Typeface Recommendations

The designer may use an existing typeface (modified as needed for the X treatment) or draw custom letterforms. Reference typefaces that capture the right spirit:

| Typeface | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Söhne** | Used by Anthropic. Clean, humanist, premium. |
| **Inter** | Highly legible, open, modern but not cold |
| **IBM Plex Sans** | Humanist warmth, professional gravitas |
| **Untitled Sans** | Clean, slightly warm, contemporary |
| **Neue Haas Grotesk** | Classic, authoritative, timeless |

**Avoid:**
- Geometric sans (Futura, Avenir) — too cold
- Display fonts — too stylized
- Serif fonts — too traditional/legal
- Rounded fonts — too friendly/consumer
- Condensed fonts — too urgent

### Letter Considerations

| Letter | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **C** | Should feel open and stable, not cramped |
| **r** | Clean, not decorative |
| **u** | Open bowl |
| **x** | THE key letter—see detailed treatment below |
| **M** | Strong, even strokes |
| **D** | Generous bowl, confident |

### Spacing

| Area | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| **Overall tracking** | Slightly open (not tight) |
| **Between "Crux" and "MD"** | Subtle additional space OR visual pause |
| **"MD" itself** | Standard or slightly tighter than "Crux" |

---

## The X Concept: Core Creative Direction

### The Idea

"Crux" literally means a decisive point or intersection. The letter X is inherently a crossing point—two lines meeting. **The X in the wordmark should be subtly treated as a graphic element that embodies this meaning.**

This is not about making the X into a separate symbol or breaking the wordmark apart. It's about giving the X a subtle distinction that rewards closer attention—a quiet sophistication.

### Approach: Subtle Integration

The X treatment must:
- Feel like part of the word, not a separate icon
- Be noticeable but not distracting
- Work at all sizes (including small)
- Not require color to be understood
- Convey precision, intersection, the decisive point

### Concept Options

The designer should explore these directions:

---

#### Option A: Extended Crossbar

The X has slightly extended strokes at the intersection point, creating a subtle "crosshair" effect—like a precise mark on a chart or measurement tool.

```
Standard X:     The strokes meet and terminate
                 \  /
                  \/
                  /\
                 /  \

Extended X:     The strokes extend slightly past the intersection
                 \  |  /
                  \ | /
               ----\/----
                  /\
                 /  \
```

**Execution notes:**
- Extensions should be subtle—perhaps 10-15% of stroke width
- All four directions, creating a + overlay at the center
- Should feel like precision, not decoration

---

#### Option B: Emphasized Intersection Point

The center of the X features a subtle visual emphasis—a small node, optical thickening, or moment of visual weight at the crossing point.

**Execution notes:**
- Could be a subtle ink trap inversion (slight thickening vs. thinning)
- Could be a tiny geometric element (diamond, circle) at center
- Must be subtle enough to work at 16px
- Should feel like the "crux" of the letter

---

#### Option C: Asymmetric Stroke Weight

The X has slight stroke weight variation that draws the eye to the intersection—perhaps the strokes thicken slightly as they approach the center.

**Execution notes:**
- Very subtle modulation
- Should not make the X look "pinched" or poorly drawn
- Creates natural visual focus at center

---

#### Option D: Negative Space Play

The X is constructed so that the negative space at center forms a subtle secondary shape—a diamond, square, or other geometric moment.

**Execution notes:**
- Requires careful stroke angle calibration
- Works best with slightly heavier stroke weights
- Should feel discovered, not obvious

---

#### Option E: Minimal Extension (Recommended Starting Point)

The simplest treatment: the X strokes extend just slightly beyond where they would normally terminate, creating the slightest suggestion of a crosshair or reference mark.

```
Normal wordmark:  CruxMD
With treatment:   Cru✕MD  (where ✕ has subtle extensions)
```

**Execution notes:**
- This is the safest, most likely to succeed at all sizes
- Extensions should be uniform (all four directions)
- Length: approximately 15-20% of stroke width
- Stroke weight: matches the rest of the letterforms exactly

---

### What to Avoid in X Treatment

| Problem | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| **Separate symbol** | Breaks the wordmark, creates "icon + text" problem |
| **Different color for X** | Too gimmicky, creates visual break |
| **Overly stylized X** | Draws too much attention, feels designed |
| **X that doesn't match letterforms** | Looks like a logo imposed on a wordmark |
| **Rotating/angling the X differently** | Looks like a mistake |
| **Adding elements inside X** | Too complex, fails at small sizes |

---

## Logo Construction

### Wordmark Structure

```
[ C r u x M D ]
  ↑       ↑
  |       |
  |       Slight visual separation (space or weight change)
  |
  The X receives subtle graphic treatment
```

### Hierarchy Options

**Option 1: Unified Weight**
All letters same weight, "MD" distinguished only by slight spacing.
```
CruxMD
```

**Option 2: Weight Variation**
"Crux" in medium weight, "MD" in semi-bold (or vice versa).
```
Crux MD
```

**Option 3: Size Variation**
"MD" slightly smaller (80-90% of "Crux" height), aligned to baseline.
```
Crux ᴹᴰ
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (unified weight) as it's most confident and least fussy. Only introduce variation if legibility demands it.

### Proportions

| Measurement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Aspect ratio** | Approximately 4:1 to 5:1 (horizontal wordmark) |
| **X-height** | Generous, prioritize legibility |
| **Cap height for M/D** | Match the full height of "Crux" |
| **Descenders** | None in this wordmark |
| **Ascenders** | None in this wordmark |

---

## Logo Variations

### Required Versions

| Version | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Primary** | Full wordmark in Book Cloth | Marketing, headers, large formats |
| **Reversed** | Full wordmark in Ivory Light | Dark backgrounds |
| **Monochrome** | Full wordmark in Slate Dark | Single-color print |
| **Monochrome Reversed** | Full wordmark in White | Single-color on dark |

### Compact Version (Favicon/App Icon)

For small formats (16x16, 32x32, app icons), a compact mark is needed:

**Recommended approach:**
- Lettermark using "Cx" (C and x combined)
- The x carries the same subtle treatment as in the full wordmark
- Single color (Book Cloth, or contextually appropriate)

**Alternative:**
- Just "C" with a subtle crux mark integrated
- Just the treated "X" as a standalone mark (only if it's distinctive enough)

## Summary

**Create a wordmark for "CruxMD" that:**

1. Uses Book Cloth terracotta (`#CC785C`) as primary color
2. Employs humanist sans-serif typography (warm, professional, not cold)
3. Features a subtle graphic treatment of the X that suggests intersection/precision
4. Reads as unified while allowing "Crux" and "MD" to be distinguished
5. Works from 512px down to 16px
6. Feels like quiet competence—premium without flash

**The X is the creative opportunity.** Make it subtle, make it meaningful, make it ownable—but don't let it overpower the wordmark. The best result will be a logo that feels obvious in retrospect: "Of course the X is special. It's the crux."
