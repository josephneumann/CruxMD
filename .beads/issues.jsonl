Replaces the task queue that was originally planned for the right sidebar.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\nPer updated dual sidebar architecture:\n- Left nav = navigation (includes \"Tasks\" link)\n- Right panel = context-specific data only (no task queue)\n- Tasks get their own page for focused triage workflow\n\n### Route\n\n`/tasks` - Full-page task queue view\n\n### Components\n\n**Page:**\n- `frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx` - Tasks page\n\n**Components:**\n- `frontend/components/tasks/TasksPage.tsx` - Main container\n- `frontend/components/tasks/TaskCategorySection.tsx` - Collapsible category (Critical, Routine, Schedule, Research)\n- `frontend/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` - Individual task card\n- `frontend/components/tasks/TaskFilters.tsx` - Filter controls\n\n### Layout\n\n```\n┌───┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│   │                                                                          │\n│ N │   TASKS                                                    [Filter ▼]   │\n│ A │   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════   │\n│ V │                                                                          │\n│   │   🚨 CRITICAL (3)                                                        │\n│ R │   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │\n│ A │   │ K+ 6.2 mEq/L                              Robert Chen │ 10m ago │  │\n│ I │   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │\n│ L │   ...                                                                    │\n│   │                                                                          │\n│   │   📬 ROUTINE (12)                                              [expand] │\n│   │   📅 SCHEDULE (8)                                              [expand] │\n│   │   📚 LEARNING (1)                                              [expand] │\n│   │                                                                          │\n│   │   [Tab] navigate • [Enter] engage • [Esc] hub                           │\n└───┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Interactions\n\n| Action | Trigger | Result |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| Navigate here | Click \"Tasks\" in left nav or quick pill | Shows /tasks page |\n| Engage task | Click task card or Enter on focused | Navigates to /chat?task=xxx |\n| Filter | Click filter dropdown | Shows filtered tasks |\n| Return to hub | Press Esc or click logo | Returns to /chat |\n| Expand category | Click category header | Shows/hides tasks in category |\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n\n- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Move between tasks\n- `↑` / `↓` - Move within category\n- `←` / `→` - Move between categories\n- `Enter` - Engage selected task\n- `Space` - Expand/collapse category\n- `Esc` - Return to hub\n\n### Task Card Content\n\n- Task type icon + color\n- Primary text (task title/key finding)\n- Patient name\n- Time since task created\n- Brief description (1-2 lines)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Tasks page renders at /tasks route\n- [ ] Left nav has \"Tasks\" link that navigates here\n- [ ] Task categories show correct counts\n- [ ] Categories are collapsible\n- [ ] Task cards show type, patient, time, summary\n- [ ] Clicking task navigates to /chat?task=xxx\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Esc, arrows)\n- [ ] Filter by category works\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Story 5.1 (Task Model \u0026 API) - for task data\n- Story 5.3 (Demo Fixtures) - for demo tasks\n- Left nav sidebar (✅ DONE) - for \"Tasks\" nav link\n\n### Updates Needed\n\n- Add \"Tasks\" nav item to `Sidebar.tsx` pointing to /tasks\n- Update \"Tasks\" quick action pill on chat page to link to /tasks","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"joseph.r.neumann@protonmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T14:25:47.537093-06:00","created_by":"Joe Neumann","updated_at":"2026-01-26T14:25:47.537093-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"CruxMD-aeg","depends_on_id":"CruxMD-mde.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T14:25:52.161745-06:00","created_by":"Joe Neumann"},{"issue_id":"CruxMD-aeg","depends_on_id":"CruxMD-mde.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T14:25:52.25267-06:00","created_by":"Joe Neumann"}]}

{"id":"CruxMD-cvc","title":"Add inter-resource relationships to Neo4j knowledge graph","description":"Enhance the Neo4j knowledge graph with edges between FHIR resources (not just Patient→Resource edges).\n\n## Background\nCurrent graph only has Patient-centric edges:\n- Patient → HAS_CONDITION → Condition\n- Patient → HAS_MEDICATION_REQUEST → MedicationRequest\n- Patient → HAS_OBSERVATION → Observation\n- Patient → HAS_ENCOUNTER → Encounter\n- Patient → HAS_ALLERGY_INTOLERANCE → AllergyIntolerance\n\n## Updated Context (from CruxMD-7y6 FHIR Audit)\nThe FHIR reference audit is complete. See docs/fhir-reference-audit.md for detailed findings.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Encounter is the temporal hub - all clinical resources have 100% coverage linking to Encounters\n- reasonReference fields provide clinical reasoning links (82% coverage for MedicationRequest, 36% for Procedure)\n- DiagnosticReport-\u003eObservation links have 87% coverage - high value for lab aggregation\n\n**Proposed Relationship Tiers (from audit):**\n- Tier 1 (Essential): Patient-\u003eEncounter-\u003eClinical events (DIAGNOSED, PRESCRIBED, RECORDED, PERFORMED)\n- Tier 2 (Clinical Reasoning): reasonReference links (TREATS), DiagnosticReport-\u003eObservation (CONTAINS_RESULT)\n- Tier 3 (Extended): CarePlan, CareTeam, Immunization links\n- Tier 4 (Administrative): Claim/EOB billing links\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- Two-pass loading: create all resources first, then build inter-resource relationships using FHIR IDs\n- graph.py will need encounter_fhir_id stored on nodes to enable second-pass relationship building\n- Handle missing reasonReference refs gracefully (variable coverage)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Update graph.py upsert methods to store encounter_fhir_id on clinical nodes\n2. Add second-pass relationship building after all resources loaded\n3. Extract and create inter-resource edges (DIAGNOSED_DURING, TREATS, etc.)\n4. Handle urn:uuid references (resolve to fhir_id)\n5. Add query methods for traversing these relationships\n6. Update tests\n\n## Value\nEnables clinical queries like:\n- 'What conditions were diagnosed during encounter X?'\n- 'What medication is treating the patient's hypertension?'\n- 'Show me everything that happened in the ER visit'\n- 'Timeline of events for this encounter'","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"joseph.r.neumann@protonmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-17T16:29:25.935469-06:00","created_by":"Joe Neumann","updated_at":"2026-01-24T16:10:05.26096-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-24T16:10:05.26096-06:00","close_reason":"Completed.
