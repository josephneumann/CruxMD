See docs/fhir-reference-audit.md for detailed findings.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Encounter is the temporal hub - all clinical resources have 100% coverage linking to Encounters\n- reasonReference fields provide clinical reasoning links (82% coverage for MedicationRequest, 36% for Procedure)\n- DiagnosticReport-\u003eObservation links have 87% coverage - high value for lab aggregation\n\n**Proposed Relationship Tiers (from audit):**\n- Tier 1 (Essential): Patient-\u003eEncounter-\u003eClinical events (DIAGNOSED, PRESCRIBED, RECORDED, PERFORMED)\n- Tier 2 (Clinical Reasoning): reasonReference links (TREATS), DiagnosticReport-\u003eObservation (CONTAINS_RESULT)\n- Tier 3 (Extended): CarePlan, CareTeam, Immunization links\n- Tier 4 (Administrative): Claim/EOB billing links\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- Two-pass loading: create all resources first, then build inter-resource relationships using FHIR IDs\n- graph.py will need encounter_fhir_id stored on nodes to enable second-pass relationship building\n- Handle missing reasonReference refs gracefully (variable coverage)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Update graph.py upsert methods to store encounter_fhir_id on clinical nodes\n2. Add second-pass relationship building after all resources loaded\n3. Extract and create inter-resource edges (DIAGNOSED_DURING, TREATS, etc.)\n4. Handle urn:uuid references (resolve to fhir_id)\n5. Add query methods for traversing these relationships\n6. Update tests\n\n## Value\nEnables clinical queries like:\n- 'What conditions were diagnosed during encounter X?'\n- 'What medication is treating the patient's hypertension?'\n- 'Show me everything that happened in the ER visit'\n- 'Timeline of events for this encounter'","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"joseph.r.neumann@protonmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-17T16:29:25.935469-06:00","created_by":"Joe Neumann","updated_at":"2026-01-24T11:40:00.178074-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"CruxMD-cvc","depends_on_id":"CruxMD-7y6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-17T16:29:31.78205-06:00","created_by":"Joe Neumann"}]}
